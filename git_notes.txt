1. To start version control of an existing folder:
    1.1 RC on that folder + Git Bash here - gir command line terminal will open
    1.2 git init - will add git stuff to that folder, so version control will start
    1.3 .git folder is created, where all info about changes/versions/branhces are stored
    1.4 if .git deleted all that info is lost - it is NOT a backup, unless using github for remote repo
    1.5 .git can be zipped and send and full repo with all info will be available
2. Adding file to git
    2.1 git status - shows versioned and unversioned files
        git add [filename] - adds file to version control
    2.2 git commit -m ['description - comment for commit'] - commits - saves version of files added to version control
        git log - shows list of commits
