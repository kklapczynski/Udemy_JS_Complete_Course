1. To start version control of an existing folder:
    1.1 RC on that folder + Git Bash here - gir command line terminal will open
    1.2 git init - will add git stuff to that folder, so version control will start
    1.3 .git folder is created, where all info about changes/versions/branhces are stored
    1.4 if .git deleted all that info is lost - it is NOT a backup, unless using github for remote repo
    1.5 .git can be zipped and send and full repo with all info will be available
2. Adding file to git
    2.1 git status - shows versioned and unversioned files
        git add [filename] - adds file to version control - stageing
    2.2 git commit -m ['description - comment for commit'] - commits - saves version of files added to version control
        git log - shows list of commits
    2.3 staging - adding many files:
        git add . - stageing of all files in dir
        git add *.html  - staging all mathcing files
3. Creating ignore list 
    3.1 git touch .gitignore
    3.2 In this .gitignore file we add files or type of files, that we don't want to stage and commit e.g. *.log
