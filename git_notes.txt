1. To start version control of an existing folder:
    1.1 RC on that folder + Git Bash here - git command line terminal will open
    1.2 git init - will add git stuff to that folder, so version control will start
    1.3 .git folder is created, where all info about changes/versions/branhces are stored
    1.4 if .git deleted all that info is lost - it is NOT a backup, unless using github for remote repo
    1.5 .git can be zipped and send and full repo with all info will be available
2. Adding file to git
    2.1 git status - shows versioned and unversioned files
        git add [filename] - adds file to version control - stageing
    2.2 git commit -m ['description - comment for commit'] - commits - saves version of files added to version control
        git log - shows list of commits
    2.3 staging - adding many files:
        git add . - stageing of all files in dir
        git add *.html  - staging all matching files
3. Creating ignore list 
    3.1 in gitbash we can use command: touch .gitignore to create ignore list file
    3.2 In this .gitignore file we add files or type of files, that we don't want to stage and commit e.g. *.log
    3.3. .gitignore file has to be staged and commited
4. Branching and merging

5. Clone repo from GITHUB:
    5.1 In GITHUB you can fork repos from others. Once it's forked - it's on your account in Github and you can clone it to local computer.
        You clone it by getting url address of this repo. You get it pressing 'Clone or download' button, where you can copy this URL.
    5.2 On your computer go to folder when you want repo downloaded and Git Bash Here. Then in terminal use command:
        'git clone [URL copied from github]'.
6. Commiting changes on local repo to remote - master repo in Github:
    6.1
